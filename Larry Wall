'''Larry Wall''' (born [[September 27]], [[1954]]) is a [[programmer]], [[linguist]], and [[author]], most widely known for his creation of the [[Perl]] [[programming language]] in 1987.  Wall earned his  [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Seattle Pacific University]] in 1976.

Wall is the author of the [[rn (newsreader)|rn]] [[Usenet client]] and the nearly universally used [[Patch (Unix)|patch]] program. He has won the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest]] twice and was the recipient of the first [[Free Software Foundation]] [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] in 1998.

Beyond his technical skills, Wall is known for his wit and often ironic sense of humor, which he displays in the comments to his [[source code]] or on [[Usenet]]. For example: "We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise."

Larry Wall has [[linguistics]] qualifications, which were useful in the design of Perl. He is the co-author of ''[[Programming Perl]]'' (often referred to as the ''Camel Book''), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers. He has edited the ''[[Perl Cookbook]]''. His books are published by [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]].

Wall's [[Christianity|Christian]] faith has influenced some of the terminology of Perl, such as the name itself, a biblical reference to the "Pearl of great price" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:46). [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise.html?pg=3] Similar references are the function name ''bless'', and the organization of Perl 6 design documents with categories such as ''[[apocalypse]]'' and ''[[exegesis]]''. Wall has also alluded to his faith when he has spoken at conferences, including a rather straightforward statement of his beliefs at the August, 1997 Perl Conference and a discussion of [[Pilgrim's Progress]] at the [[YAPC]] (Yet Another Perl Conference) in June, 2000.

While in [[graduate school]], Wall and his wife were studying [[linguistics]] with the intention afterwards of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in [[Africa]], and creating a [[writing system]] for it. They would then use this new writing system to translate various texts into the language, among them the [[Bible]]. Due to health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained in the U.S., where Larry instead joined the [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] after he finished grad school.

Wall continues to oversee further development of Perl and serves as the [[Benevolent Dictator for Life]] of the Perl project{{cn}}. His role in Perl is best conveyed by the so-called ''2 Rules'', taken from the official Perl documentation:

:# ''Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave. This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.''
:# ''Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.''
:''Got that? Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.''
