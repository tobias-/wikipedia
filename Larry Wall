'''Larry Wall''' is the developer of the [[Perl]] programming language.  
Wall is also known as the original author of the [[rn]] [[Usenet]] software, and the nearly universally used [[patch]]. He has won the [[IOCCC]] twice, and was the recipient of the first [[Free Software Foundation]] award for the Advancement of [[Free Software]] in 1998.

Beyond his technical skills, Wall is known for his wit and often ironic sense of humor which he displays in the comments to his [[source code]] or on [[Usenet]] (e.g. "We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise") 

Larry Wall is a [[linguist]] by trade, which helped him with his book writing. He is the co-author of [[Programming Perl]] (often called the [[Camel Book]])([http://safari.oreilly.com/JVXSL.asp?x=1&mode=section&sortKey=title&sortOrder=asc&view=&xmlid=0-596-00027-8&open=false&g=&srchText=BOOK+AND+%28AUTHOR+Larry+Wall%29&code=&h=&m=&l=1&catid=&s=1&b=1&f=1&t=1&c=1&u=1&r=&o=1&page=0 preview online]), which is the definitive resource for Perl programmers.
