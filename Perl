'''Perl''', also '''Practical Extraction and Report Language''' (a [[backronym]], see [[#Name|below]]), is a [[programming language]] released by [[Larry Wall]] on [[December 18]], [[1987]] that borrows features from [[C programming language|C]], [[sed]], [[awk]], [[UNIX shell|shell]] scripting ([[UNIX shell|sh]]), and (to a lesser extent) from many other programming languages as well. 

== Rationale  ==
Perl was designed to be a practical language to extract information from text files and to generate reports from that information. One of its mottos is "There's more than one way to do it" (TMTOWTDI - pronounced 'Tim Toady'). Another is ''Perl: the Swiss Army Chainsaw of Programming Languages''. One stated design goal is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. Its versatility permits versions of many programming paradigms: [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[functional programming|functional]], and [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented]] (though some claim that Perl is not a cleanly designed language because of its multiple paradigms). Perl has a powerful [[regular expression]] engine built directly into its syntax. Perl is often considered the archetypal [[scripting programming languages|scripting language]] and has been called the "glue that holds the web together", as it is one of the most popular [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] languages. Its function as a "glue language" can be described broadly as its ability to tie together different systems and interfaces that were not designed to interoperate.

Perl is one of the [[programming language]] components of the popular [[LAMP]] free software platform for web development.

Perl is [[free software movement|free software]], available under a combination of the ''[[Artistic License]]'' and the [[GPL]]. 
It is available for most [[operating system|operating systems]] but is particularly prevalent on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems (e.g: [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]]), and is growing in popularity on [[Microsoft Windows]] systems. As an example of Perl in action, [[Wikipedia]] itself was a [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] script written in Perl until January [[2002]]. Another example is [[Slashdot]], which runs on the Perl-based [[Slashcode]] software.
When used on the web, Perl is often used in conjunction with the [[Apache web server]] and its [[mod_perl]] module.

== Implementation ==
A huge collection of freely usable [[perl module]]s, ranging from advanced mathematics to database connectivity, networking and more, can be downloaded from a network of sites called [[CPAN]], an [[Acronym|acronym]] for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. Most or all of the software on CPAN is also available under either the [[Artistic License]], the [[GPL]], or both. CPAN.pm is also the name of the Perl module that downloads and installs other Perl modules from one of the CPAN mirror sites: such installations can be done with interactive prompts, or can be fully automated.

Although Perl has most of the ease-of-use features of an interpreted language, it does not strictly interpret and execute source code one line at a time. Rather, perl (the program) first compiles an entire program to an intermediate [[byte code]] (much like [[Java programming language|Java's]] byte code), optimizing as it goes, and then executes that byte code. It is possible to compile a Perl program to byte code to save the compilation step on later executions, though the "interpreter" is still needed to execute that code.

== Current Version ==
The current version, 5.8.3, includes [[Unicode]] support. Development of the next major release, Perl 6, is also underway. It will run on [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]], a [[virtual machine]] which is being developed as a possible multi-language target architecture.

== Control structures ==
The basic control structures do not differ greatly from those used in the [[C programming language|C]] or [[Java programming language|Java]] programming languages:

''Loops''

 while (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 }

 do {
     ''statement(s)''
 } while (''Boolean expression'');

 do {
     ''statement(s)''
 } until (''Boolean expression'');
''For one-line statements, "until" and "while" can also be used as follows'':
 ''statement(s)'' until ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement(s)'' while ''Boolean expression'';


 for (''initialisation'' ; ''termination condition'' ; ''incrementing expr'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 }

 foreach ( ''array'' ) {
     ''statement(s)''
 }


''If-then-statements''

 if (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 }

 unless (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 }
''For one-line statements, "unless" can be used as follows'':
 ''statements'' unless ''Boolean expression'';

 if (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 } else {
     ''statement(s)''
 }

 if (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 } elsif (''Boolean expression'') {
     ''statement(s)''
 }

''For one-line statements, "if" can be used as follows'':
 ''statements'' if ''expression'';

== Subroutines ==
[[Subroutine]]s in Perl can be specified with the [[keyword]] 'sub'.  [[Variable]]s passed to a subroutine appear in the subroutine as elements of the local (to the subroutine) scalar array @_.  Calling a subroutine with three scalar variables results in array elements @_[0], @_[1], and @_[2] within the subroutine.  Note that these elements would be referred to as the scalars $_[0], $_[1], and $_[2].

Changes to elements in the @_ array within the subroutine are reflected in the  elements in the calling program.

Subroutines naturally return the value of the last expression evaluated, though explicit use of the ''return'' statement is often encouraged for clarity.

An example subroutine definition and call follows:

 ...

 sub cube
 {
   my $x = $_[0];
   $x * $x * $x;
 }

 ...

 $z = -4;
 $y = cube($z);
 print "$y\n";

 ...

== Perl and [[SQL]] databases == 
[[DBI/DBD]] modules can be used to access most [[ANSI]] [[SQL]] databases,
including [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]] and [[Oracle database|Oracle]].

== Perl 5 ==
Perl5, the most current production version of perl, is an interpreter which processes the text of a Perl script at runtime. Thus, the [[debugger]] is invoked directly from the command line with
<PRE>
        perl -dw ScriptName.pl Argument1 ... ...
</PRE>
Note that there is no limit to the number of arguments: Perl is polyadic;  any number of arguments can be passed to any Perl subroutine, in general. This concept of "no arbitrary limits" is present in most other parts of the language as well. Perl can read a ten million byte string into a variable, if the machine has the memory for it.

== Perl 6 ==
Perl6 is currently under development, and is planned to separate parsing and compilation and runtime, making the a virtual machine that is more attractive to developers looking to port other languages to the architecture.

The [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] is the Perl6 runtime, and can be programmed at a low level in [[Parrot assembly language]]. Parrot has existed in a limited form since December 2003. An increasing number of languages have been implemented to various degrees for the Parrot to be 'compiled' to Parrot assembly language opcodes. Besides a subset of the planned Perl6, these include BASIC, Befunge, Cola, Forth, Jako, Ook!, Plot, and even Python, Ruby, and Scheme.

== Perl Code Samples ==
The canonical "[[hello world]]" program would be:

 #!/usr/bin/perl
 print "Hello world\n";

The first line is the [[shebang]], which indicates the interpreter for Unix-like operating systems. The second line prints the string 'Hello world' and a [[newline]] (like a person pressing 'Return' or 'Enter').

Some people humorously claim that Perl stands for 'Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister' due to the high use of meaningful punctuation characters in the language [[syntax]], as may be seen in this example program to print a greeting:

 <nowiki># A sample Perl program</nowiki>
 $_ =&nbsp;"Hello, world! The magic number is 234542354.\n";
 print;
 s/\d+/-1/;
 print;

and its output:

 Hello, world! The magic number is 234542354.
 Hello, world! The magic number is -1.

The fourth line of the example shows the use of a [[regular expression]].

In common with [[C programming language|C]], [[obfuscated code]] competitions are an interesting feature of the Perl culture.
Similar to obfuscated code but with a different purpose, Perl [[Poetry]] is the practice of writing poems that can actually be compiled by perl. This practice is fairly unique to Perl, due to the large number of regular English words used in the language. New poems can regularly be seen [http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Perl%20Poetry here].

== Name ==

"Perl" was originally named "pearl", after the "pearl of great price" of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:46. Larry Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations and claims he looked at (and rejected) every three- and four-letter word in the dictionary. He even thought of naming it after his wife Gloria.

Before the language's official release Wall discovered that there was already a programming language named "pearl", and changed the spelling of the name. Several [[backronym]]s have been suggested, including the humorous ''Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister''. ''Practical Extraction and Report Language'' has prevailed in many of today's manuals, including the official Perl [[man page]]s. The name is normally capitalized ("Perl") when referring to the language, and uncapitalized ("perl") when referring to the interpreter program itself. (There is a saying in the Perl community that ''"Nothing but perl can parse Perl"''.)
