NOTES FOR EDITORS

* "Perl" is not an acronym (read the "Name" section below). Do not put that here.
* [[mod_perl]] is a correct link. Do not remove the underscore wherever you see it.
* Perl is described as the 'Swiss Army *chainsaw*', not the 'Swiss Army knife' of programming languages. Read the ref.
