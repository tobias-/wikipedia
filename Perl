'''Perl''', also '''Practical Extraction and Report Language''' (a [[backronym]], see [[#Name|below]]), is a [[programming language]] released by [[Larry Wall]] on [[December 18]], [[1987]] that borrows features from [[C programming language|C]], [[sed]], [[awk]], [[Unix shell|shell]] scripting ([[Bourne shell|sh]]), and (to a lesser extent) from many other programming languages.

== Rationale  ==
Perl has been ported to over a hundred different platforms, and the mission of making the language available everywhere is commemorated in the name of the main newsgroup for issues relating to perl development, "perl5-porters". Perl is widely used in [[web development]], [[finance]] and [[bioinformatics]], and indeed in most sectors where a premium is placed on rapid development and the availability of a large number of standard and 3rd-party modules. Because of its wide availability, Perl, like [[Java programming language|Java]], is often considered to be a platform in its own right, packaging a Unix-like environment in which software can be written once, and generally run without modifications almost everywhere. In addition to its numerous binary ports, Perl can, with only 6 reported exceptions, be compiled from [[source code|source]] on all Unix-like, [[POSIX]]-compliant or otherwise Unix-compatible platforms, including [[AmigaOS]], [[BeOS]], [[Cygwin]], and [[Mac OS X]]. Custom binary ports are available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (ActivePerl) and [[Mac OS|Mac OS Classic]] (MacPerl). [http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/]

Perl was designed to be a practical language to extract information from text files and to generate reports from that information. One of its mottos is "There's more than one way to do it" (TMTOWTDI - usually pronounced 'Tim Toady', but keeping in line with the motto, there's more than one way to do it). Another is ''Perl: the Swiss Army Chainsaw of Programming Languages''. One stated design goal is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. Its versatility permits versions of many programming paradigms: [[procedural programming|procedural]], [[functional programming|functional]], and [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented]] (though some claim that Perl is not a cleanly designed language because of its multiple paradigms). Perl has a powerful [[regular expression]] engine built directly into its syntax. Perl is often considered the archetypal [[scripting programming languages|scripting language]] and has been called the "glue that holds the web together", as it is one of the most popular [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] languages. Its function as a "glue language" can be described broadly as its ability to tie together different systems and interfaces that were not designed to interoperate.

Perl is one of the [[programming language]] components of the popular [[LAMP]] free software platform for web development.

Perl is [[free software movement|free software]], available under a combination of the ''[[Artistic License]]'' and the [[GPL]]. It is available for most [[operating system|operating systems]] but is particularly prevalent on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems (such as [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and [[Mac OS X]]), and is growing in popularity on [[Microsoft Windows]] systems. Examples of Perl in action include [[Wikipedia]], which was a Perl [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] script until January [[2002]], and [[PHP]], which was also originally written in Perl. Another example is [[Slashdot]], which runs on the Perl-based [[Slashcode]] software. When used on the web, Perl is often used in conjunction with the [[Apache web server]] and its [[mod_perl]] module.

Perl is regarded by both its proponents and detractors as something of a grab bag of features and syntax. The difference between the two camps lies in whether this is seen as a virtue or a vice. Critics argue that the language's indulgence of different "dialects" and paradigms leads to "write-only" code, and that its easily-obfuscated mixture of [[sigil (computer programming)|sigil]]s, special variables, and "[[Huffman coding|Huffman encoded]]" shortcuts renders Perl code indistinguishable from "[[line noise]]". Perl votaries maintain that the language's expressiveness and varied heritage are what make it so useful. Reference is often made to natural languages such as [[English language|English]], and to [[evolution]]. For example, Larry Wall has argued that:

:''... we often joke that a camel is a horse designed by a committee, but if you think about it, the camel is pretty well adapted for life in the desert. The camel has evolved to be relatively self-sufficient. On the other hand, the camel has not evolved to smell good. Neither has Perl.''

In recognition of its pungent-but-practical nature, Perl has adopted the [[camel]] as its mascot; and the [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] manual on Perl, ''[[Programming Perl]]'', is known as the '''camel book''': so named because of the camel that graces its cover.

== Implementation ==
A huge collection of freely usable [[perl module]]s, ranging from advanced mathematics to database connectivity, networking and more, can be downloaded from a network of sites called [[CPAN]], an [[Acronym|acronym]] for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. Most or all of the software on CPAN is also available under either the [[Artistic License]], the [[GPL]], or both. As of January 1, 2005, CPAN includes more than 7,000 modules, contributed by nearly 4,000 authors.

A major advantage of Perl for those who work with large quantities of data is that it is highly scalable, as it does not place arbitrary limits on the sizes of its built in data structures. Resources permitting, a Perl program can read an entire multi-gigabyte file into RAM. This flexibility in the face of bulky data dumps has made Perl popular among [[bioinformatics]] researchers, who routinely read substantial fractions of the human genomic sequence into Perl data structures.

CPAN.pm is also the name of the Perl module that downloads and installs other Perl modules from one of the CPAN mirror sites: such installations can be done with interactive prompts, or can be fully automated.

Although Perl has most of the ease-of-use features of an interpreted language, it does not strictly interpret and execute source code one line at a time. Rather, perl (the program) first compiles an entire program into an internal form (a parse tree) which is then optimized before being run.  Perl's [[formal grammar]] is interesting in that it is context-free but cannot be parsed by a [[Yacc]] generated parser. This produces a number of differences from traditional interpreters. Any syntax errors are caught during the compile stage instead of later during execution. Subroutine calls can be placed in the file before the subroutines themselves are defined. And long-running programs are rather fast and efficient compared to strictly-interpreted languages, at the expense of short programs suffering the overhead of the compile-optimize stage. Since version 5.005 it has been possible to compile a Perl program to byte code to save the compilation stage on later executions, though the "interpreter" is still needed to execute that code. This could be seen as a precursor to [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]].

== Current version ==
The current version, 5.8.6, released on [[November 27]] [[2004]], includes [[Unicode]] support. Development of the next major release, Perl 6, is also underway. It will run on [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]], a [[virtual machine]] which is being developed as a possible multi-language target architecture.

== Built-in data types ==

Perl has three built-in [[data type]]s: [[scalar]]s, [[array]]s, and [[hash table|hashes]]. A scalar holds a single value, such as a string, number, or reference. Arrays are ordered lists of scalars indexed by number starting at 0. Hashes, or [[associative array]]s, are unordered collections of scalar values indexed by their associated key.

Scalars, arrays, and hashes can be assigned to named variables. The first character of the variable name identifies the type of data held within the variable. The remaining part identifies the particular value the variable refers to.

Names of scalar values always begin with '$', regardless of whether the variable referred to belongs to an array or hash. For example,

  $months[11]           # the 12th element of the array @months
  $address{'Jim'}       # the 'Jim' element from hash %address

Arrays are named with '@', indicating that multiple values are to be returned. For example,

  @months               # ( $months[0], $months[1], ..., $months[n] )
  @months[2,3,4]        # same as ( $months[2], $months[3], $months[4] )
  @address{'Jim','Bob'} # same as ( $address{'Jim'}, $address{'Bob'} )

Entire hashes begin with '%', as in %address.

==Control structures==

The basic control structures are similar to those used in the [[C programming language|C]] or [[Java programming language|Java]] programming languages:

===Loops===

 ''label'' while ( ''expr'' ) ''block''
 ''label'' while ( ''expr'' ) ''block'' continue ''block''
 ''label'' for ( ''expr1'' ; ''expr2'' ; ''expr3'' ) ''block''
 ''label'' foreach ''var'' ( ''list'' ) ''block''
 ''label'' foreach ''var'' ( ''list'' ) ''block'' continue ''block''

where ''block'' is a sequence of one of more perl statements surrounded by braces:

 { ''statement(s)'' }

The label, which is terminated by a colon, is optional, but, if present, can be used by loop control statements.

* The ''next'' statement moves to the next iteration of the loop identified by the label.
* The ''last'' statement immediately terminates execution of the loop identified by the label.
* The ''redo'' statement restarts the current iteration of the loop identified by the label.

Within nested loops, the use of the label with ''next'', ''redo'' and ''last'' enables control to move from an inner loop to an outer one, or out of the outer loop altogether.

In the ''for'' statement, the semantics are similar to [[C programming language|C]]. The first expression is evaluated prior to the first loop iteration; the second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration and the loop is terminated if it evaluates to boolean false; and the third expression is evaluated after each iteration, prior to deciding whether to perform the next.

The use of a ''continue'' block after a ''while'' or ''foreach'' statement allows code to be executed after each iteration - even if the current iteration has been cut short by a ''next'' statement.

In ''foreach'', the ''var'' is a scalar variable. It is optional, and, if omitted, the default loop iterator variable $_ can be used instead.  

In addition, any simple expression (that is, any non-block) can be executed repeatedly by following it by one of the qualifiers:

    while (''expr'')
    until (''expr'')

which have the expected meaning.

When combined with the ''do'' construct, this provides a form of looping:

  do ''block'' while (''expr'');
  do ''block'' until (''expr'');

The test is performed after each iteration, so that execution of the block is guaranteed to take place at least once.

Due to a linguistic foible of the Perl language, these are not regarded as true loops; the ''next'', ''last'' and ''redo'' statements cannot be used inside a 'do' block.

By itself, ''do'' executes a string of statements once, and evaluates to the value of the last statement:

  do ''block'';

===If-then statements===

 if ( ''expr'' ) ''block''

 unless ( ''expr'' ) ''block''

 if ( ''expr'' ) ''block''
 else ''block''

 if ( ''expr'' ) ''block''
 elsif ''block''
 else ''block''

''block'' is { ''statement(s)'' }

The expression is evaluated in a boolean sense.  If it is numeric, any non-zero value is true.  If it is string, any string of non-zero length ''except'' "0" is true.  "" is false.  "0" is false.  "0.0" is true. "00" is true. "-0" is true.

An empty array or hash is evaluated in a scalar context, yielding false:

 my @a=(); print "True" if @a;

Nothing is printed in this example.

===Statement modifiers===

For simple statements, <code>while</code>, <code>until</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>unless</code> and <code>foreach</code> can also be used as statement modifiers:

 ''statement'' while ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' until ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' if ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' unless ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' foreach ''list'';

The above modifiers cannot be nested, so this would be incorrect:

 ''statement'' if ''expression'' for ''list'';

and should be written as:

 ''expression'' and ''statement'' for ''list'';

The keywords <code>for</code> and <code>foreach</code> are synonyms and are always interchangeable.

As noted earlier, the modifiers ''while'' and ''until'' can be combined with ''do'' to create a multiple-statement looping structure.

===Switch statement===

There is no explicit switch statement in [[#Perl 5|Perl 5]] similar to that used in C. Switch statements are built with general blocks:

 SWITCH: {
     if (''expression'') { ''statement(s)''; last SWITCH; }
     if (''expression'') { ''statement(s)''; last SWITCH; }
     ''default statement(s)'';
 }

or:

 SWITCH: {
     ''statement'', ''statement'', last SWITCH  if ''expression'';
     ''statement'', ''statement'', last SWITCH  if ''expression'';
     ''default statement(s)'';
 }

or using <code>elsif</code>:

 if (''expression'')
     { ''statement(s)'' }
 elsif (''expression'')
     { ''statement(s)'' }
 elsif (''expression'')
     { ''statement(s)'' }
 else
     { ''default statement(s)'' }

In [[#Perl 6|Perl 6]] the switch statement is built with the <code>given</code> topicalizer and <code>when</code> "smart match" statements:

 given ''expression'' {
     when ''expression'' { ''statement(s)'' }
     when ''expression'' { ''statement(s)'' }
     default { ''statement(s)'' }
 }

== Subroutines ==
[[Subroutine]]s in Perl can be specified with the [[keyword]] <code>sub</code>.  [[Parameter (computer science)|Parameter]]s passed to a subroutine appear in the subroutine as elements of the local (to the subroutine) scalar array <code>@_</code>.  Calling a subroutine with three scalar variables results in a <code>@_</code> with three elements, usually referred to as the scalars <code>$_[0]</code>, <code>$_[1]</code>, and <code>$_[2]</code>. Also <code>shift</code> (from [[shell script| shell scripting]]) can be used, without specifying <code>@_</code>, to obtain each value.

Changes to elements in the <code>@_</code> array within the subroutine are reflected in the  elements in the calling program.

Subroutines naturally return the value of the last expression evaluated, though explicit use of the <code>return</code> statement is often encouraged for clarity.

An example subroutine definition and call follows:

<pre>
 sub cube
 {
   my $x = shift;
   return $x ** 3;
 }

 $z = -4;
 $y = cube($z);
 print "$y\n";
</pre>

Named parameters are often simulated by passing a hash. For example:

<pre>
 sub greeting
 {
   my %person = @_;
   return "Hello, $person{first} $person{last}!\n";
 }

 print greeting(
   first => 'Foo',
   last  => 'Bar'
 );
</pre>

==Regular expressions==

The Perl language includes a specialized syntax for writing [[regular expression]]s (REs),
and the interpreter contains an engine for matching strings to REs.
The RE engine uses a backtracking algorithm; 
this extends its capabilities from simple pattern matching
to string capture and substitution.

The Perl regular expression syntax was originally taken from Unix Version 8 
regular expressions.
However, it diverged before the first release of Perl,
and has since grown to include many more features.

The <code>m//</code> (match) operator introduces a regular expression match.
In the simplest case, an expression like

  $x =~ m/abc/

evalues to true iff the string <code>$x</code> matches the regular expression <code>abc</code>.
To capture a matched string, surround the part of the RE that you want 
with parentheses and evaluate it in list context.
This is more interesting for patterns that can match multiple strings

  ($matched) = $x =~ m/a(.)c/;   # capture the character between 'a' and 'c'

The <code>s//</code> (substitute) operator specifies a search and replace operation

  $x =~ s/abc/aBc/;   # upcase the b

Perl regular expressions can take ''modifiers''.
These are single-letter suffixes that modify the meaning of the expression

  $x =~ m/abc/i;   # case-insensitive pattern match

Perl regular expressions can be dense and cryptic.
Partly, this is because regular expression matching is an inherently 
complex operation,
and partly it is because the RE syntax is extremely compact.
Some relief from the second problem is afforded by the /x modifer, 
which allows programmers to place whitespace and comments ''inside'' 
regular expressions

  $x =~ m/a     # match 'a'
          .     # match any character
          c     # match 'c'
           /x;

One common use of regular expressions is to specify delimiters for the <code>split</code> operator.

  @words = split m/,/, $line;   # divide $line into comma-separated values

The <code>split</code> operator complements string capture.
String capture returns strings that match the RE;
<code>split</code> returns strings that don't match the RE.

==Perl and SQL databases==

[[Perl DBI]] can be used to access most [[ANSI]] [[SQL]] databases, including [[MySQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], and [[Oracle database|Oracle]].

== Perl 5 ==
Perl5, the most current production version of perl, is an interpreter which processes the text of a Perl script at runtime. Thus, the [[debugger]] is invoked directly from the command line with

  perl -dw ScriptName.pl Argument1 ... ...

Note that there is no limit to the number of arguments: Perl is polyadic;  any number of arguments can be passed to any Perl subroutine, in general. This concept of "no arbitrary limits" is present in most other parts of the language as well. Perl can read an entire file into a variable, if the machine has the memory for it.

== Perl 6 ==

''Main article:'' [[Perl 6]]

Perl 6 is currently under development, and is planned to separate parsing and runtime, making a virtual machine that is more attractive to developers looking to port other languages to the architecture.  Perl 6 plans to parse itself, and moreover expose its parser to the language itself. That is, a module could alter the [[Context free grammar|grammar]] for the program that imported it.

[[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] is the Perl 6 runtime, and can be programmed at a low level in [[Parrot assembly language]] (PASM) or [[Parrot IMC|Intermediate Code]] (IMC or PIR, for Parrot Intermediate Representation).

== Perl code samples ==
The canonical "[[hello world]]" program would be:

 <nowiki>#</nowiki>!/usr/bin/perl -w
 
 print "Hello, world!\n";

The first line is the [[shebang]], which indicates the interpreter for Unix-like operating systems. (It is the most common, but not the only way of ensuring that the perl interpreter runs the program.) The second line prints the string 'Hello world' and a [[newline]] (like a person pressing 'Return' or 'Enter').

Some people (including [[Larry Wall]]) humorously claim that Perl stands for "Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister" due to its philosophy that there should be many ways to do the same thing, its growth by accretion, and its origins in report writing. 

There are many other jokes, including the annual [[Obfuscated Perl contest]], which makes an arch virtue of Perl's [[syntax|syntactical]] flexibility. The following program, which prints a greeting that is modified by a [[regular expression]], is a mild example of this pastime:

 <nowiki>#</nowiki> A sample Perl program
 $_ =&nbsp;"Hello, world! The magic number is 234542354.\n";
 print;
 s/\d+/-1/;
 print;

Here is its output:

 Hello, world! The magic number is 234542354.
 Hello, world! The magic number is -1.

==Name==
Perl was originally named "Pearl", after "the pearl of great price" of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:46. Larry Wall wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations, and claims he looked at (and rejected) every three- and four-letter word in the dictionary. He even thought of naming it after his wife Gloria. Before the language's official release, Wall discovered that there was already a programming language named [[Pearl programming language|Pearl]], and changed the spelling of the name.

The name is normally capitalized (''Perl'') when referring to the language, and uncapitalized (''perl'') when referring to the interpreter program itself since Unix-like filesystems are case sensitive. (There is a saying in the Perl community: "Only perl can parse Perl.")
It is not appropriate to write "PERL" as it is not really an [[acronym]], although several [[backronym]]s have been suggested, including the humorous ''Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister''.
''Practical Extraction and Report Language'' has prevailed in many of today's manuals, including the official Perl [[man page]]. It is also consistent with the old name "Pearl": ''Practical Extraction And Report Language''.

== Fun with Perl ==
In common with [[C programming language|C]], [[obfuscated code]] competitions are a popular feature of Perl culture.
Similar to obfuscated code but with a different purpose, Perl [[Poetry]] is the practice of writing poems that can actually be compiled by perl. This hobby is more or less unique to Perl, due to the large number of regular English words used in the language. New poems are regularly published in the [[Perl Monks]] site's [http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Perl%20Poetry Perl Poetry] section.

Another popular pastime is Perl golf. As with [[golf|the physical sport]], the objective is to reduce the number of strokes that it takes to complete a particular objective, but here "strokes" refers to keystrokes rather than swings of a golf club. A task, such as "scan an input string and return the longest [[palindrome]] that it contains", is proposed, and participants try to outdo each other by writing solutions that require fewer and fewer characters of Perl source code.

Another tradition among Perl [[hacker]]s is writing JAPHs, which are short obfuscated programs that print out the phrase "[[Just another Perl hacker]],". The "canonical" JAPH includes the comma at the end, although this is often omitted, and many variants on the theme have been created (example: [http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=292135], which prints "Just Another Perl Pirate!").

One interesting Perl module is Lingua::Romana::Perligata. This module translates the source code of a script that uses it from Latin into Perl, allowing the programmer to write executable programs in Latin.

The Perl community has set aside the "Acme" namespace for modules that are fun or experimental in nature.  Some of the Acme modules are deliberately implemented in amusing ways.  Some examples:
* [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-Hello/ Acme::Hello] simplifies the process of writing a "Hello, World!" program
* [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-Currency/ Acme::Currency] allows you to change the "$" prefix for scalar variables to some other character
* [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-ProgressBar/ Acme::ProgressBar] is a horribly inefficient way to indicate progress for a task
* [http://search.cpan.org/dist/Acme-VerySign/ Acme::VerySign] satirizes the widely-criticized [[Verisign]] SiteFinder service
